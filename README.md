📊 Exploratory Data Analysis on Titanic Dataset

Objective: 
Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset to understand its structure, identify missing values, analyze key variables, 
and uncover patterns affecting passenger survival.

Tools:
Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Jupyter Notebook

🔗 Dataset Used  
Source: [Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data?select=train.csv)  
The train.csv file containing 891 passenger records was used for the analysis.

🔍 Features  
- Data summary and type inspection  
- Missing value detection and handling  
- Univariate and bivariate visualizations  
- Correlation heatmap for numerical features  
- Observations and insights for each analysis step  

📁 Files Included 
- TitanicDatasetEDA.ipynb – Jupyter Notebook containing all code, visualizations, and observations  
- TitanicDatasetEDA.pdf – Exported PDF version of the analysis report  
- README.md – Project description and summary  

✅ Outcome
This task demonstrated the ability to perform end-to-end data exploration using Python’s data analysis libraries. 
The analysis revealed patterns such as higher survival rates for females and first-class passengers, as well as correlations between fare and survival. 
Missing values were addressed to prepare the dataset for potential predictive modeling.  

Submitted as part of Task 5 for the Data Analyst Internship.
